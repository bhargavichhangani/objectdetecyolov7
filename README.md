# objectdetecyolov7

The YOLOv7 algorithm takes an image as input and then uses a simple deep convolutional neural network to detect objects in the image. YOLO v7 uses nine anchor boxes, which allows it to detect a wider range of object shapes and sizes compared to previous versions, thus helping to reduce the number of false positives.

Our project explores the implementation and optimization of YOLOv7 for object detection, aiming to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency.
